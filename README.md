# Hello, World! 👋

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a Bachelors in finance. Upon graduation, I worked as an Investment Analyst for a consulting/wealth management overseeing $1.2 billion AUM. Took me about two years to realize I wanted to pursue a career that had more opportunity to be creative and have a positive impact. And this is where my coding journey began.

I'm adaptable, well-organized, and a master of leveraging the latest technologies and frameworks to streamline development processes. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for continuous learning, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my expertise to drive innovation and deliver exceptional results that create a positive impact.

When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy playing soccer, golfing, working out, and pretty much anything that involves exercise. Big foodie. Huge Niners fan. Massive Arsenal supporter.
